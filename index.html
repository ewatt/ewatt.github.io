	<h1>Hi there, I'm Ian Watt!</h1>
	<p>I am a recent graduate of the Computer Systems Technology program at Seneca College and I am seeking to gain employment in a Networking and Computer Systems Administration role.

I have always had a keen interest in computer systems and networking technologies and I am always seeking to further expand my skills and knowledge. My previous work experience has required the use of my exceptional trouble shooting and problem solving skills, and my ability to quickly learn and master new technologies. I am methodical and detail oriented in solving computer and network related issues and I have the communication skills needed to relay complex information in easily understood terms.

I have extensive personal experience working with a variety of Linux server and workstation distributions and I am able to automate common tasks with Perl and Bash shell scripting.  I am comfortable working from, and prefer to work from a command-line interface.  I have a diverse knowledge of various internet and routing protocols such as the TCP/IP suite, DHCP, DNS, SSH, OSPF, IPv6, OpenVPN and IPSec.  I have experience working with container technologies such as Docker as well as working with virtualization technologies such as VMware, VirtualBox, and KVM.</p>
